We were inspired to create a game based on the Los Angeles fires after seeing how unpredictable and intense these wildfires can be. The idea was to turn this real-world event into an engaging yet thought-provoking meme game, capturing the chaos, urgency, and survival instincts needed in such situations. Our goal is to blend humor with awareness while keeping the gameplay fun and fast-paced.
